# Hi, I’m Ryan!

I'm a senior at UT Austin focusing on Applied Mathematics and Computational Science. I hope to pursue graduate studies after completing my bachelor's. 

I started learning how to program as a kid, but my formal studies in the subject began at UT in 2019. I've grown fond of computer science as it relates to practical problem solving, and would like to continue to improve my programming skills in order to tackle more interesting and impactful problems.

My public work on GitHub reflects what projects I'm working on in my free time. If you see anything that interests you, feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to collaborate and help where I can.

# What I'm working on

I'm currently focusing on Numerical Methods and Analysis.
