# Hi, I’m Ryan!

I'm a senior at UT Austin focusing on Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I hope to work as a software engineer after I graduate, and plan to pursue a Master's degree part-time while doing so.

I started learning Python in 2019, and love using it to analyze and solve problems. In 2022, I started branching out into other technologies like Java and HTML/CSS/JS to see what else is out there. 

My work on GitHub reflects what I'm working on in my free time - if you see anything that interests you, feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to collaborate and help where I can.

# What I'm working on

I'm currently focusing on Data Structures and Software Design.
