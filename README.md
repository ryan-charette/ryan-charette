# Hello, I'm RyanðŸ‘‹

## ðŸŽ“ About Me
- ðŸ“š I'm a graduate student specializing in **Computer Science** and **Pure Mathematics**.
- ðŸ’» I have strong interests in **Computational Topology** and **Automated Logic**.
- ðŸŒŸ Passionate about exploring the intersection of mathematics and computational methods.

## ðŸ§® Academic Interests
- **Pure Mathematics**: Deeply interested in topology, Riemann surfaces, and number theory.
- **Computational Topology**: Currently reading [Elementary Applied Topology](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/notes.html) by Robert Ghrist.
- **Automated Logic**: Investigating the use of computational methods in logic, focusing on automated theorem proving.

## ðŸš€ Current Projects
- **Tripodal Graphons**: Collaborating on exploring the phase transition betwwen bipodal and tripodal forms in the edge-triangle model.
- **Rotational Dynamics**: Working on a research paper on rigid body rotation, aiming to determine the onset of chaotic motion as a function of the initial conditions.

## ðŸ›  Skills and Technologies
- **Mathematical Tools**: LaTeX, MATLAB
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, C++.
- **Software/Libraries**: Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, SciPy, Astropy

## ðŸ“š Learning and Development
- Currently enhancing my skills in C++.
- Attending workshops and seminars on abstract harmonic analysis.
